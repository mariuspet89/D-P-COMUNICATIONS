            <h3>Review from Lexi Murray</h3>
            <p>D&P Communications has been my service provider for several years following their
              buyout of TC3net. They have excellent customer service at their local service locations.
              They have great Internet service, which is reliable and with the new fiber
              tic lines installed and high DSL, I am able to work from home for my
              clients without interruptions and run multiple devices on my home Wi-Fi
              systems without lag time. The folks at D&P are knowledgeable and very
              customer service orientated. I would recommend their services to anyone
              new to the area!</p>

              Great reliable service! Also have a business account

            <h2>"Wish I'd Switched to D & P Sooner"</h2>
            <h3>Review from Robert S.</h3>
            <p>Fantastic! D&P advertised 110 MBPS download.
              I am getting - through my router 107 MBPS. Upload
              speed is 23 MBPS. Can't argue with that can you?
              Compare to Frontier DSL which was 3.5 MBPS download
              (they promised 10 I think) and 0.25 MBPS upload.
              Pathetic! They started out with at about 8.5
              MBPS and then after a couple weeks I was lucky to hit 4 MBPS!
              This was after they begged for me to stay with them!
              Well finally I switched. I wish I would have done it sooner!
              D&P came out, installed the equipment quickly an efficiently.
              The installer was knowledgeable and professional.
              They arrived around the time they said they would -
              a little earlier actually. I'm so happy!
              I'll update later if anything changes but, freak'n awesome so far...
